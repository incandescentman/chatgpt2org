* ChatGPT2Org

ChatGPT2Org is an Emacs package that allows you to copy HTML content from a browser and paste it directly into an Emacs org-mode buffer as correctly parsed org-mode content. It's designed to work with any HTML content, but it includes additional cleanup functions that are specifically optimized for content generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT 4. This README and the majority of the cleanup functions' code were originally generated by ChatGPT 4, then further refined by me as needed.

** Motivation

ChatGPT offers a "copy" feature that allows you to copy its responses in Markdown format. However, this has to be done for each individual response, which can be time-consuming if you want to copy an entire conversation. I created ChatGPT2Org to enable the copying of an entire ChatGPT conversation at once and facilitate the direct pasting of this content into Emacs in well-formatted org-mode syntax.

** Features

- *HTML to Org Conversion:* The function converts HTML content from your clipboard into org-mode format, allowing you to paste the content directly into an org-mode document.

- *Removal of Base64-Encoded Images:* ChatGPT2Org removes all base64-encoded images from the converted text, resulting in a clean, text-focused output.

- *Link Removal:* Links beginning with "https://chat.openai.com" or "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com" are removed to declutter the output.

- *Excessive Newlines Reduction:* The function identifies and reduces instances of excessive newlines in the converted text, enhancing readability.

- *Unnecessary Characters Removal:* Various unnecessary symbols and strings are removed from the converted text, further improving readability.

- *Org-mode Properties Removal:* All org-mode properties are removed from the converted text, keeping the output focused on the main content.

- *Code Blocks Formatting:* The function correctly formats both source code and example blocks for org-mode.

- *Correct Inline Code Enclosure:* Inline code enclosed with "=" is replaced with "~", following org-mode syntax.

** Installation

To install ChatGPT2Org, download the =chatgpt2org.el= file to your local system. Then, add the directory containing this file to your =load-path= and use =use-package= to load the ChatGPT2Org package:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/chatgpt2org/")
(use-package chatgpt2org)
#+end_src

Replace ="/path/to/chatgpt2org/"= with the actual path to the directory containing =chatgpt2org.el=.

If you do not have =use-package= installed, you can load the file directly:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load "/path/to/chatgpt2org.el")
#+end_src

** Usage

After installing the package, you can invoke the =chatgpt2org= function in any buffer by using =M-x chatgpt2org=. This command retrieves the content from your clipboard, processes it, and pastes the resulting formatted content at your cursor position.

** Dependencies

ChatGPT2Org requires Emacs 24.3 or later.

** License

ChatGPT2Org is distributed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for more details.

** Acknowledgements

The initial core functionality of this package is based on a solution provided in an answer on the StackExchange Emacs site [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/12121/org-mode-parsing-rich-html-directly-when-pasting][(link)]]. The code evolved over time to eliminate unwanted characters. Once ChatGPT was released, I used it to add cleanup functions specifically optimized for parsing HTML copied from ChatGPT.
