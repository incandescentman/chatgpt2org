* ChatGPT2Org
ChatGPT2Org enables you to copy HTML content from a browser and paste it as correctly parsed org-mode format content into an Emacs org-mode buffer. It works with any HTML content, but I've added cleanup functions specifically optimized for content generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT 4. This README and most of the code for the cleanup functions were written by ChatGPT 4 then revised by me as necessary.

** Why I found this necessary
ChatGPT provides a "copy" button allows you to copy its answers in markdown format. However, you have to do this piecemeal for every answer separately. I wanted a way to copy an entire conversation with ChatGPT and paste it into Emacs in nice, nicely parsed org-mode format.

** Features
- *HTML to Org Conversion:* The function transforms the HTML content in your clipboard into an Org-mode format, allowing you to paste the content directly into an Org-mode document.
- *Removal of Base64-Encoded Images:* The function removes all base64-encoded images from the converted text, ensuring a clean, text-focused output.
- *Link Replacement:* Any links beginning with "https://chat.openai.com" or "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com" are removed for a cleaner document.
- *Excessive Newlines Reduction:* The function identifies and removes instances of excessive newlines in the converted text, thus ensuring a tidy and readable document.
- *Unnecessary Characters Removal:* It takes away various unnecessary symbols and strings from the converted text, enhancing overall readability.
- *Properties Removal:* All Org-mode properties are cleared from the converted text, maintaining simplicity and focus on the primary content.
- *Code Blocks Formatting:* The function recognizes code block instances and formats them appropriately for Org-mode, encompassing both source code and example blocks.
- *Correct Enclosing for Inline Code:* Inline code enclosed within "=" is replaced with "~", following Org-mode syntax.

** Installation
To install ChatGPT2Org, download the =chatgpt2org.el= file to your local system and add its path to your =load-path= list. Then, use =use-package= to load the ChatGPT2Org package. Here's an example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/chatgpt2org/")
(use-package chatgpt2org)
#+end_src

Make sure to replace ="/path/to/chatgpt2org/"= with the actual path to the folder containing the downloaded =chatgpt2org.el= file.

Note: If you do not have =use-package= installed, you can install it by loading the file directly:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load "/path/to/chatgpt2org.el")
#+end_src

** Usage
Once the package is installed, you can invoke the =chatgpt2org= function in any buffer by using =M-x chatgpt2org=. This command pulls the content from your clipboard, processes it, and pastes the newly nicely formatted content at your cursor.

** Dependencies
ChatGPT2Org may require Emacs 24.3 or later.

The initial core functionality of this package is based on a solution provided in an answer on the StackExchange Emacs site [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/12121/org-mode-parsing-rich-html-directly-when-pasting][(link)]]. The code evolved over time to strip out unwanted garbage character. Then once ChatGPT was released, I used ChatGPT itself to add cleanup functions optimized for parsing HTML copy-pasted from ChatGPT.
